- `bangalore.csv`: Dataset containing hotel information (used in the script).

## üîß Features & Analysis Performed

1. **Average Price by Star Rating**
2. **Average Rating by Location**
3. **Correlation Between Reviews and Ratings**
4. **Price Distribution (Boxplot)**
5. **Tax vs Price Scatter Plot**
6. **Hotel Distribution by Star Rating (Pie Chart)**
7. **Most Reviewed Hotel**
8. **Most Expensive Hotel**
9. **Average Price by Rating**
10. **Average Rating by Landmark**
11. **Average Distance to Landmark**
12. **Top Locations with 5-Star Hotels**
